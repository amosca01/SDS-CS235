          "The first identifiable damage from this tornado began on Friendship Road north northwest of Ramer. A detached metal and wood garage at this location was destroyed with numerous hardwood and softwood trees uprooted and snapped on the property. The tornado moved to the northeast and caused damage to a property on Teague Lane. Another large garage made of metal and wood was destroyed. A single-family residence on this property sustained a significant loss of roof material. The tornado moved eastward along Feddie Davis Road and caused additional hardwood and softwood tree damage. The tornado likely dissipated in a wooded area west of Highway 45.  Peak winds were estimated at 105 mph.",
          "An EF-1 tornado began in northern Somerset County near Bernardsville along the NJ Transit Line just to the southwest of the intersection of Minebrook Rd and Old Quarry Rd. There it dropped numerous trees onto the NJ Transit Line and snapped the trunk|of around ten trees. As it moved to the northeast, the storm uprooted two maple trees along Mine Brook behind the Rose Bowl Baseball field that were on a slight embankment. The storm continued to move towards the northeast into Bernardsville|where it produced tree damage along Laurel Lane and snapped the trunk of a tree that appeared not to be fully healthy. The tornado then started to move more towards the north following Mine Brook through Bernardsville producing damage from Timber|Rock Trail to Anderson Hill Rd where it snapped the trunk of a pine tree that ended up falling on a vehicle. The peak width of the tornado was over this area where the damage path was approximately Four hundred seventy five yards between the damage from Timber Rock Trail to Anderson Hill Rd. Additional damage was found along the path of Anderson Hill Rd moving to the north towards the intersection of Seney Dr and Anderson Hill Rd where numerous trees were brought down with at least two ending up on power lines. At the intersection of Anderson Hill Rd and Rolling Hill Rd, another|large tree had its trunk snapped. However, the interior of the tree was determined not to be healthy, so the expected winds based on the DoD were reduced significantly. As the storm was starting to occlude and weaken, it took down several more trees along|Old Fort Road including uprooting multiple trees with wide, but shallow root systems. The tornado then dissipated as the storm moved further to the northeast. The EF-1 rating is primarily based on the number of trees with snapped trunks with the highest|concentration in a single location being along the NJ transit line. This is where the damage indicator of hardwood trees with degree of damage of trunks snapped produced an expected wind speed of one hundred five mph.",

The initial damage included some roof damage to a gazebo where the panels were blown off. It looks like at the strongest damage point it was estimated that the tornado was 75 yards in width. Just across from the park to the northeast, the roof of a house was nearly completely destroyed. There was a carport attached to the roof which was demolished, and the roof was then lifted off and carried across maybe 20 yards across the street and impacted another house. This second house had the cars in the driveway lifted and turned a few feet. The home suffered structural damage to the front wall with cracks spreading towards the back of the home. These two homes appeared to suffered the most direct damage. Turning north down the road, the neighborhood had similar damage to siding of the homes as most of the damage came from a southwest to northeast direction. Snapped trees, patio furniture tossed, and broken windows were the most common impacts. Near the end of the path, a large shed's roof was lifted off and carried a few feet away. About 3/4 mile northeast of the start point, the tornado likely weakened as the damage becomes more minor consisting of roof siding damage and snapped twigs. On the northern sides of homes, hail damage was evident due to hail being driven onto the sides of homes on the north side of the tornado.

The tornado began in a wooded area near the Autauga/Elmore County line, with snapped tree tops observed west of Highway 143. It tracked northeastward and began to intensify as it reached Coosa River Road and Foreman Road, where multiple hardwood trees were uprooted, a barn was damaged, and minor shingle damage occurred to residences. It continued to uproot trees, damage outbuildings, and remove shingles from homes as it crossed Highway 111 near Chase Drive and Toad Road. More hardwood trees were uprooted along Shady Nook Drive before it began to cross the Shoal Creek inlet of Jordan Lake. It remained over the lake for a little while and uprooted trees near the Lightwood Road bridge, some of which fell on residences. The tornado reached its maximum intensity as it reached the northeast side of Jordan Lake. Multiple residences on Circle Drive suffered roof damage with much of the roof removed from one residence. Many hardwood trees were snapped and some boathouses were destroyed. The tornado continued to move along the northeast shore of the lake uprooting trees, some of which fell on residences, and caused roof damage. Dozens of residences suffered varying levels of damage. The tornado exited the lake near Joe's Fish Camp Road, where several hardwood trees were uprooted. The tornado became progressively weaker while continuing to uproot a few trees, eventually dissipating northeast of Titus Road prior to reaching Highway 231.",
          "An EF-2 tornado with estimated maximum winds near 130 mph touched down west-southwest of the Haile community, crossing Ford and Arkansas Roads in a very rural area where hardwood and softwood trees were were snapped and uprooted. The tornado continued on to the east-northeast, producing mostly tree damage as it crossed Cypress Road and Albert Barr Road. In addition, falling trees downed many power lines in this area as it moved to the northeast for two to three miles. The most significant damage occurred a little farther to the northeast as the tornado crossed Wheeler Road. At this location, there were a few collapsed electrical transmission towers which were rated as high-end EF-2 damage with estimated 130 mph winds. From here, the last few miles of the tornado tracked closer to the Haile community, crossing Highway 143, Jordan Taunton Road, Sunset Road, Haile Baptist Church Road, and Jessie Guinn Road. In these areas, the damage was again confined to mainly snapped and uprooted trees, with several homes and outbuildings heavily damaged, but mainly due to downed trees. The tornado was unique in a few ways. First, the path width was up to a half a mile in the latter portion of the track, which is very wide for a tornado which was mostly weak throughout a majority of its path. Secondly, the collapsing of the large electrical transmission towers garnered a rating up to 130 mph, but there were no other surveyed damage indicators which warranted an EF-2 rating. The survey team believes there could be other significant damage indicators near the downed transmission towers, although potentially live downed high voltage lines in the vicinity of the towers did not allow the survey team to survey in close proximity.",

          "An EF-1 tornado with estimated maximum winds near 100 mph touched down near County Road 52 near Lake Columbia. There, it snapped several softwood trees before continuing onward into forested areas where it caused intermittent damage. As the tornado continued to move northeast, damage was again observed near North Mill and North Cottage Street where trees were snapped and uprooted. The tornado continued on to uproot and snap trees as it crossed Washington and Neil Streets in the city of Waldo. Prior to reaching Highway 371, the tornado damaged an awning of a church, before knocking over several power poles and snapping trees across several blocks in Waldo. On the northeast side of the city limits, the tornado completely destroyed a small metal outbuilding and continued on to snap more trees at the edge of a farm before lifting.",

          "An EF-1 tornado with estimated maximum winds near 107 mph touched down along Pleasant Hill Road east of Highway 15 (Haynesville Highway) and tracked generally in a northeasterly direction across Spot Attaway Road and Wesson Road, snapping and uprooting numerous hardwood and softwood trees. The most significant structural damage was observed as the tornado crossed Emma Drive west of Parkers Chapel Road. Here, two double-wide manufactured homes were partially shifted off their cinder blocks but remained intact with no other damage. Two outbuildings were also destroyed. One outbuilding was small and entirely made out of wood, but its 2x4 vertical support boards were driven 3 feet into the ground during construction and mostly remained in place. The other outbuilding was much larger and consisted of a metal roof and frame, which was twisted to a great degree. The expected wind speeds for these two outbuildings and their degree of damage were in the low EF-2 range. However, given the all-wood construction of the first building and its support beams remaining partially buried, and a distinct lack of widespread tree damage in the immediate vicinity, the estimated wind speeds were lowered, resulting in an EF-1 rating, which was also more consistent with the vast majority of the damage observed. ||The tornado continued northeast across Parkers Chapel Road and through a couple of neighborhoods south and east of Parkers Chapel School. Widespread snapping and uprooting of large softwood pine trees occurred in this area. Structural damage in this area was caused by the falling trees rather than the tornado itself. One uprooted tree fell through a single-wide manufactured home occupied by three people when the tornado struck. Fortunately, no injuries occurred in this home. ||More snapped and uprooted softwood trees were observed as the tornado crossed Lynn Drive, Evans Drive, Ables Drive, Rilla Street, Oleta Avenue, Wotapi Street, and Highway 15. The tornado began to weaken as it continued northeast out of the Parkers Chapel community but snapped another softwood tree north of Buchanan Road east of Highway 15 before finally lifting near the intersection of Highway 15/Highway 82 on the southwest side of El Dorado.",

          "This long track tornado began just southwest of Black Hawk in a wooded area with widespread tree damage, including snapped and uprooted trees. Satellite imagery indicates major tree damage of EF2 intensity. It continued northeast before crossing Highway 430, CR 235, and Highway 17. In this area, numerous residential structures were damaged, including 2 homes that were destroyed, with both losing outer walls and another with collapsed brick on the exterior with the interior slab exposed. Large farming equipment was also blown over on the side. No injuries were reported in this area. The tornado was strongest just northeast of here at EF3 intensity, around 155mph, where Black Hawk Independent Church, Historic Blackhawk School and parsonage were completely destroyed. Both the school and church had stood for nearly 100 years. The church steeple was gone with the bell thrown out and not seen by the survey team. The slab to the church remained intact with a few exterior walls standing. A nearby well building made of cinder block masonry stood mostly untouched outside of minor damage to the roof and doorway. The tornado then continued to the northeast before crossing Highway 17 where widespread tree damage and some structural damage continued. It then continued northeast, just north of Highway 243, before crossing Highway 218 and Nebo Rd, where widespread tree damage occurred. Some areas beyond this were inaccessible due to fallen trees. Satellite imagery indicates potential EF2 to EF3 tree damage in the nearby wooded area. The tornado crossed CR 144, CR 163, CR 211, Good Hope Rd and Spring Lake Rd between Burkhead Lake, Spring Lake and Water Lake. In this area, the tornado was an estimated one half to three quarters of a mile wide and caused EF2 to EF3 tree damage to the forested areas. Some damage was noted to structures along these inaccessible areas. It then crossed Enon Rd, where damage was noted to a home, and Highway 35, where widespread tree damage, major roof, and minor siding damage occurred to a mobile home. One mobile home just north of Highway 35 was thrown off the blocks and into a nearby wooded area some 50 yards away. In this location, 3 fatalities occurred. An 18 wheeler tractor trailer was also blown over on the side. Just to the northeast, satellite imagery indicates a structure had major damage, with the majority of it destroyed. The tornado then crossed CR 278 and CR 61, with minor tree damage, but the majority of the more intense tree damage as viewed within satellite imagery occurred in inaccessible areas just to the north. It then crossed Gum Branch Rd before crossing Interstate 55, where ground surveys and satellite imagery indicated the tornado was nearly a half mile wide. The tornado then crossed Highway 51, Stafford Wells Rd and Highway 407, where major roof damage occurred to residential homes consistent with EF2 intensity. The tornado then crossed Highway 82, where numerous power lines were downed, causing high end EF1 to low end EF2 damage. The tornado then crossed the intersection of Bethlehem Community Rd and Bethlehem Church Rd, where EF2 damage occurred. Three outbuildings were destroyed. A home had major roof damage, and another structure moved off the foundation. The tornado then crossed Hammond Rd, causing major tree damage in the wooded areas. The tornado then caused low end EF2 damage just south of Robinson-Thompson Rd, where an outbuilding was destroyed and a nearby 100 year old home had minor to moderate roof and siding damage but was left standing. The tornado lifted as it crossed Robinson-Thompson Rd. The maximum estimated wind gusts in Carroll County were 165 mph. The total path length was 29.57 miles across the two counties.",

          "An EF1 tornado embedded within a quasi-linear convective system, or squall line, began west of Broken Bow along Poppy Road and proceeded to advance nearly 5 miles northwest and then north of the city before lifting as it crossed Highway 259. Most the damage was in the form of uprooted trees lying to the north or northeast, but some trees were lying to the northwest. This fact, in combination with signs of convergence in the damage pattern, was enough to give confidence in categorizing this as a tornado. The highest winds estimated in the 90 to 100 mph range, and the maximum width of nearly 400 yards, was in the vicinity of where the tornado crossed Highway 3. A few structures were damaged in this tornado, but mainly due to falling trees.",

          "This tornado crossed into western Crawford County from Jasper County at 9:03pm CDT.  The tornado tracked northeastward, doing minor structural damage to a machine shed along County Highway 1 near Pierceburg.  Numerous wooden power poles were snapped and heavy damage to trees was noted with tops sheared off about 30 feet above ground.  Structural damage to homes of the EF1-EF2 variety occurred as the tornado moved across County Highway 15 where two single family homes sustained major roof damage.  A mobile home was torn in half with its debris strewn about 20 yards in opposite directions.  Trees, while sparse in this area, were sheared about 20-30 feet above the ground.  Further east along County Highway 15, structural damage occurred to a large machine shed where a stationary semi-trailer blew into its west-facing wall causing the entire structure to fail.  The debris from the large machine shed then blew into an old, poorly anchored single-family residence and caused exterior walls to slide off its foundation.  Over the next 3 miles along the path of the tornado just before it reached the south side of Robinson, considerable tree damage was observed.||As the tornado tracked into the south side of Robinson, it narrowly missed a major oil refinery.  The tornado destroyed two manufactured homes resulting in two fatalities as it crossed County Highway 9 near the interchange of East 900th Avenue and North 1200th Street.  Damage to structures, trees, and wooden power poles was determined to be EF1-EF2.||Heavy structural damage (EF3) and an additional fatality were noted on the east side of Robinson near the interchange of State Highway 1 and East 1050th Avenue where a two-story masonry building experienced failure to its top story walls.  The adjacent properties also experienced heavy damage where the exterior walls of two |single-family homes collapsed.  Damage to trees and utility poles in this area was extensive due to the amount of debris strewn toward the northeast. ||The tornado then moved over Robinson Municipal Airport, destroying airport hangers and a small outbuilding.  The progressive collapse of the rigid frames of the metal building systems, which included steel beams measuring greater than 18 inches in diameter, caused the survey team to estimate EF3 damage at this point.||A continuous track of EF1 damage then extended northeastward across County Highway 5 where multiple single-family homes exhibited large sections of their roof structures removed.  In addition, multiple large machine sheds experienced a collapse of their wall structures. ||The survey team concluded that the storm likely maintained its intensity as it tracked northeastward toward the Wabash River, noting about a quarter-mile wide swath of heavy tree damage to distant tree lines as it continued toward the river.

          "An EF-1 tornado with estimated maximum winds near 104 mph touched down west of Zeke Road just north of the intersection of Zeke Road and Highway 154 in Western Bienville Parish just southwest of Ringgold. Shortly after crossing Zeke Road while moving in an east-northeasterly direction, the tornado reached its peak estimated wind speed near 104 mph as the NWS survey team found numerous snapped softwood trees on a heavily wooded property. The tornado continued a consistent movement to the east-northeast for another quarter mile, before turning sharply to the southeast and crossing back over Highway 154. This rather atypical tornadic movement was represented quite closely in the associated radar data. Many trees were uprooted and a few were snapped as the tornado crossed Highway 154 and the team was not able to survey more damage from the ground due to lack of road access until the tornado next crossed Highway 4 near the intersection of Highway 4 and PR 537. The tornado also uprooted numerous hardwood and softwood trees here, while also snapping a few softwoods. It is possible that the tornado continued a bit farther than the endpoint represented in the survey, but the NWS survey team could not confirm this due to the lack of ground access immediately to the southeast. An overwhelming majority of the damage in this tornado was limited to trees, although throughout the path, there were a handfull of residences and structures damaged by falling trees and downed limbs. Pictures were also submitted of a funnel cloud to the west of this surveyed tornado and east of Lake Bistineau. While it is possible there was another tornado touchdown a little west of this tornado, the survey team did not have any ground access to conduct a survey in this area.",

          "New high-resolution areal imagery in concert with a reanalysis of radar data, areal surveys and ground surveys it has been determined that there were multiple tornadoes on the ground simultaneously in southwest Spalding and Northwestern Pike Counties as well as crossing tornado paths. The tornadoes were part of a larger mesocyclone which can be traced west all the way back to the Selma Alabama tornado. Our analysis determined that this tornado would become the dominant circulation which impacted Griffin and much of Spalding County and Southern Henry County. The tornado first touched down in Northwest Pike County along HWY 362 west of Irish Hill Drive where a few trees were snapped and uprooted and quickly increased in intensity to EF1 as it crossed Kings Bridge Road, Huff Creek Rd and Scott Road where numerous trees were snapped and uprooted. As the storm crossed Blanton Mill Road more severe damage was noted both on the ground and areal survey and it was determined that EF2 damage was present in the area around Nunnally Rd and Bethany Road where widespread snapping of trees occurred and a few structures were severely damaged. However, the updated analysis shows that this area also experienced crossing tornado paths both from this tornado and another which struck the area approximately 2 minutes later. The combination of the 2 paths likely resulted in more intense damage indicators. As the storm continued north into southern Spalding County, the circulation briefly weakened causing only sporadic low end EF0 damage northward along Scott Barch Road. It should also be noted that this circulation would pass into southern Spalding County along Scott Barch Road just 2 minutes ahead of another EF1 tornado to cross its path coming in from the west. The tornado continued north crossing Scott Barch Road and uprooting trees in an area south of Blanton Mill Road. Per both radar data and damage on the ground the tornado would pivot within the larger mesocyclone in an area north of Blanton Mill and begin its track east crossing Rover Zetlla Road destroying a barn. It was near this point the tornado and the wind damage would significantly increase as the tornado was intensifying rapidly. The tornado would quickly reach peak intensity of 150-155 mph and several homes were completely destroyed along Kendall Drive and West Road. 2 homes in particular were noted to be completely destroyed down to the foundation however further inspection of the homes revealed that the walls were not anchored fully anchored into the concrete thus a higher rating could not be determined from those homes. The resident of one of those homes rode out the storm in his bathtub, however the bathtub and all plumbing fixtures were torn away from the slab and tossed into the nearby woods. The survivor of the home was miraculously uninjured and got out to help neighbors. Further west along Kendall Drive several homes were also completely destroyed with several others suffering major damage thus the EF3 rating. The damage along West Road in particular garnered a slight upgrade in the wind speed to high end EF3 damage per a reanalysis. Major to severe damage was also noted along Maloy Road, Hwy 16, areas around Griffin High School, The club at Shoal Creek and North Pine Hill Road. As the tornado approached Hwy 19, per UGA faculty, the UGA facility at Dempsey Farm recorded a wind speed of 81.1 mph before the anemometer/wind combo instrument blew off the tower. The tornado continued ENE through the community of Experiment to the NW of the town of Griffin crossing HWY 92 where numerous business and homes suffered damage either from wind or fallen trees consistent with EF0 through EF1 damage. A weather instrument on the south end of the tornado swath at the UGA Griffin Campus recorded a 73.9 mph wind gust as the storm passed by. Damage in the area was consistent with EF0 type wind damage. The tornado struck a Hobby Lobby building in an around Experiment St and Hwy 92 which suffered severe damage to the roof, and exterior walls on the northeast side. Damage to the building was consistent with EF2 winds of approximately 130 mph. The tornado continued Northeast through the northside of Griffin with mostly EF0-EF1 type wind damage. Pockets of more severe damage were noted along Northside Drive and McIntosh Road consistent with high end EF1 damage. The tornado continued northeast crossing Smoak Road and N. McDonough road where it was noted both on the ground and from the air that the circulation weakened and the damage become more sporadic in nature particularly the area from Amelia rd eastward to I75 in southern Henry County. Once the circulation crossed I75 intensity of the tornado increased to a mid to high end EF1 with damage in the city of Locust Grove. The tornado crossed LG Griffin Road where it impacted numerous homes in a subdivision and snapped or uprooted trees. The storm crossed Stanley K Tanger Road and through another neighborhood affecting several homes including some high end EF1 damage. As the storm crossed Hwy 23 numerous trees were snapped or uprooted and a new TDS appeared on radar. The tornado continued NE across Jackson St, Grove Park Drive, Skyland Dr, S. Unity Grove Road and S Ola grove road snapping and uprooting trees as well as causing EF0 or in some cases EF1 damage to homes. The storm continued ENE snapping and uprooting trees through Peaksville Road where it shortly thereafter become less defined and eventually merged with the circulation/tornado ongoing to the south in the Jenkinsburg area.",

          "A rapidly-developing mini-supercell formed ahead of an approaching squall line near the Lower Texas coast just before 4 AM Saturday, May 13. The supercell spawned a quick spin-up tornado that struck the town of Laguna Heights, Texas, over a two-minute period before the circulation moved over Laguna Madre Bay and rapidly dissipated. The tornado tracked to the east-northeast after the circulation was impacted by the approaching squall line, creating a boomerang effect since the original motion of the radar couplet was to the north-northwest prior to touchdown. Winds may have reached 110 mph, the top of the EF1 scale, in a few locations ��� but the very poor quality of construction suggests 105 mph is a better estimate.||The strongest portion of the tornado, rated EF1, flattened at least six poorly built mobile home structures, removed part of the second story of a local business, and removed the majority of roof decking on at least ten other residences and buildings. At least a half dozen ash and mesquite trees were snapped or uprooted and two wooden power poles were bent. Casualties were found in several of the demolished mobile homes. A man in his forties was killed when the home collapsed on him.

          "A rapidly-developing mini-supercell formed ahead of an approaching squall line near the Lower Texas coast just before 4 AM Saturday, May 13. The supercell spawned a quick spin-up tornado that struck the town of Laguna Heights, Texas, over a two-minute period before the circulation moved over Laguna Madre Bay and rapidly dissipated. The tornado tracked to the east-northeast after the circulation was impacted by the approaching squall line, creating a boomerang effect since the original motion of the radar couplet was to the north-northwest prior to touchdown. Winds may have reached 110 mph, the top of the EF1 scale, in a few locations ��� but the very poor quality of construction suggests 105 mph is a better estimate.||The strongest portion of the tornado, rated EF1, flattened at least six poorly built mobile home structures, removed part of the second story of a local business, and removed the majority of roof decking on at least ten other residences and buildings. At least a half dozen ash and mesquite trees were snapped or uprooted and two wooden power poles were bent. Casualties were found in several of the demolished mobile homes. A man in his forties was killed when the home collapsed on him. Five others were injured in the same cluster of damaged homes, and two more were injured in a flattened mobile home near the shoreline of Laguna Madre Bay. Two of the injuries, in the home along the bayfront, required extended hospitalizations. Thirty-eight additional residents were displaced by the tornado and were housed at the local events center with American Red Cross assistance.

          "New high-resolution areal imagery in concert with a reanalysis of radar data, areal surveys and ground surveys it has been determined that there were multiple tornadoes on the ground simultaneously in southwest Spalding and Northwestern Pike Counties as well as crossing tornado paths. The tornadoes were part of a larger mesocyclone which can be traced west all the way back to the Selma Alabama tornado. Our analysis determined that this tornado would become the dominant circulation which impacted Griffin and much of Spalding County and Southern Henry County. The tornado first touched down in Northwest Pike County along HWY 362 west of Irish Hill Drive where a few trees were snapped and uprooted and quickly increased in intensity to EF1 as it crossed Kings Bridge Road, Huff Creek Rd and Scott Road where numerous trees were snapped and uprooted. As the storm crossed Blanton Mill Road more severe damage was noted both on the ground and areal survey and it was determined that EF2 damage was present in the area around Nunnally Rd and Bethany Road where widespread snapping of trees occurred and a few structures were severely damaged. However, the updated analysis shows that this area also experienced crossing tornado paths both from this tornado and another which struck the area approximately 2 minutes later. The combination of the 2 paths likely resulted in more intense damage indicators. As the storm continued north into southern Spalding County, the circulation briefly weakened causing only sporadic low end EF0 damage northward along Scott Barch Road. It should also be noted that this circulation would pass into southern Spalding County along Scott Barch Road just 2 minutes ahead of another EF1 tornado to cross its path coming in from the west. The tornado continued north crossing Scott Barch Road and uprooting trees in an area south of Blanton Mill Road. Per both radar data and damage on the ground the tornado would pivot within the larger mesocyclone in an area north of Blanton Mill and begin its track east crossing Rover Zetlla Road destroying a barn. It was near this point the tornado and the wind damage would significantly increase as the tornado was intensifying rapidly. The tornado would quickly reach peak intensity of 150-155 mph and several homes were completely destroyed along Kendall Drive and West Road. 2 homes in particular were noted to be completely destroyed down to the foundation however further inspection of the homes revealed that the walls were not anchored fully anchored into the concrete thus a higher rating could not be determined from those homes. The resident of one of those homes rode out the storm in his bathtub, however the bathtub and all plumbing fixtures were torn away from the slab and tossed into the nearby woods. The survivor of the home was miraculously uninjured and got out to help neighbors. Further west along Kendall Drive several homes were also completely destroyed with several others suffering major damage thus the EF3 rating. The damage along West Road in particular garnered a slight upgrade in the wind speed to high end EF3 damage per a reanalysis. Major to severe damage was also noted along Maloy Road, Hwy 16, areas around Griffin High School, The club at Shoal Creek and North Pine Hill Road. As the tornado approached Hwy 19, per UGA faculty, the UGA facility at Dempsey Farm recorded a wind speed of 81.1 mph before the anemometer/wind combo instrument blew off the tower. The tornado continued ENE through the community of Experiment to the NW of the town of Griffin crossing HWY 92 where numerous business and homes suffered damage either from wind or fallen trees consistent with EF0 through EF1 damage. A weather instrument on the south end of the tornado swath at the UGA Griffin Campus recorded a 73.9 mph wind gust as the storm passed by. Damage in the area was consistent with EF0 type wind damage. The tornado struck a Hobby Lobby building in an around Experiment St and Hwy 92 which suffered severe damage to the roof, and exterior walls on the northeast side. Damage to the building was consistent with EF2 winds of approximately 130 mph. The tornado continued Northeast through the northside of Griffin with mostly EF0-EF1 type wind damage. Pockets of more severe damage were noted along Northside Drive and McIntosh Road consistent with high end EF1 damage. The tornado continued northeast crossing Smoak Road and N. McDonough road where it was noted both on the ground and from the air that the circulation weakened and the damage become more sporadic in nature particularly the area from Amelia rd eastward to I75 in southern Henry County. Once the circulation crossed I75 intensity of the tornado increased to a mid to high end EF1 with damage in the city of Locust Grove. The tornado crossed LG Griffin Road where it impacted numerous homes in a subdivision and snapped or uprooted trees. The storm crossed Stanley K Tanger Road and through another neighborhood affecting several homes including some high end EF1 damage. As the storm crossed Hwy 23 numerous trees were snapped or uprooted and a new TDS appeared on radar. The tornado continued NE across Jackson St, Grove Park Drive, Skyland Dr, S. Unity Grove Road and S Ola grove road snapping and uprooting trees as well as causing EF0 or in some cases EF1 damage to homes. The storm continued ENE snapping and uprooting trees through Peaksville Road where it shortly thereafter become less defined and eventually merged with the circulation/tornado ongoing to the south in the Jenkinsburg area.",

          "The tornado first touched down in a field southwest of Certier Road, about three miles northeast of Buford. This tornado affected a property on Certier Road, causing significant damage to several barns, with winds estimated to 90 mph. From here, the tornado generally moved to the north-northeast.||Tree damage and minor structural damage was noted on Ruble Cemetery Road and Hollowtown Road. More significant damage was noted at a couple of properties on State Route 131. One home had an attached garage that was compromised by the wind and detached from the main structure of the house, mostly flattening the walls of the garage. Significant roof and tree damage was also found at a couple of adjacent properties. Winds here were estimated at 100 mph.||Damage north of State Route 131 was much sparser, with minor tree damage observed on Dawson Road and north of Barr Cemetery Road. A power pole was downed on Sherry Road. Overall, while the tornado did travel through mostly open fields north of State Route 131, it is likely that it weakened or briefly lifted during this time period.||A more concentrated area of damage was then observed near the intersection of Danville/Russell Road and US Route 50. While some tree damage was noted on the west side of Danville/Russell Road, more extensive damage was noted to the east. A church on the south side of US Route 50 was heavily damaged, with the majority of the east side of the roof removed.

About a half mile of EF1 intensity damage then occurred along West Rock East Road including multiple trees snapped at the trunk.  Near the midpoint of the track upon crossing South Lee Phillips Road, the tornado caused isolated tree and home damage including uprooted a hardwood tree and blowing out a window.  0.9 miles later the tornado reached peak intensity over a slight rise of ground, with winds snapping trees, destroying a wood-anchored shed, and bending an anchored steel plate.  The tornado then turned to the east-southeast, and again exhibited peak intensity upon crossing South Rockport Road where a well-built barn was partially destroyed and a 2-story home sustained extensive roof damage.  For the final 0.8 miles of its track, the tornado roughly paralleled South Rockport Road while occasionally snapping pine trees, before ending about 4 miles west of the western end of Monroe Lake.",
          "A tornado briefly touched down off of US-70 along Highway 436. It ripped a few shingles off of a single-family home and then went on to down large limbs on trees. An occlusion led to the northward motion of the tornado as it damaged another roof of a home and then led to the major loss of roof panels to a small metal outbuilding before lifting. A special thanks goes out to Carroll County Emergency Management for their assistance in locating damage on the survey. Peak winds were estimated at 85 mph.",

This was the point where the tornado reached its maximum with of about 700 yards (0.4 miles). The tornado struck a small farmstead along Tuckers Road. The house appeared to have slide off its foundation and collapsed. 2 barns on the property were completely destroyed along with snapped trees and power poles. Farther east, several homes sustained damage from fallen trees and wind blowing off roof material. A few irrigation pivots were blown over in this area. Numerous trees were snapped or uprooted along Owens Road and Sharps Mill Road near Tuckers Road. Just east of Tuckers Road, a single family house sustained significant structural damage. A large section of roof was blown off and an exterior wall was partially blown out. Several windows were blown out and the vinyl fencing on the property was almost completely blown away. A few more trees and minor cosmetic damage to structures occurred a few hundred yards east of Tuckers Road as the tornado continued northeast. Another residence was struck by the tornado on Tuckers |Road where a large portion of exterior wall along the attic was blown off. The home's chimney was also blown off and a few windows were blown out. A detached garage on the property had its roof almost completely blown off. A chicken house behind the residence had a small portion of its roof blown off. Some trees were uprooted along a tree line before the tornado moved into a large and inaccessible wooded area.||The tornado appeared to have maintained a fairly steady intensity as it continued northeast toward Ellendale while crossing several roads. The tornado crossed Oak Road, B and R Road, Oakley Road, Union Church Road, and Beaver Dam Road. Along these road crossings, the tornado produced consistent tree damage and some minor cosmetic damage to some homes. More notable areas of damage include: a large chicken house along B and R Road was severely damaged with some collapse of the northern end of the structure; A house along Oakley Road had an exterior garage wall pushed inward; more significant tree damage was also noted along Oakley Road; and a small portion of a single family house was blown off on Beaver Dam Road.||The tornado crossed US Route 113 into Ellendale where sporadic tree damage occurred in a residential area along Sharons Road. An entire attached garage roof and walls were blown off on a single family home on Pine Oak Street near Sharons Road. Some other houses sustained roof material blown off in this area. The tornado crossed Beach Highway/Main Street near Old State Road where some minor tree damage occurred and some shingles were blown off of a few homes. The tornado crossed Washington Avenue and McCaulley Avenue where a small portion of roof material was blow off of a |free standing garage. The tornado began to weaken considerably moving northeast of downtown Ellendale. It crossed Ponder Road where some roof material was blown off of a automotive service building. The tornado continued into a wooded area then crossed |Holly Tree Road emerging into a field. The tornado circulation dissipated around 6:19 PM EDT just after turning over an irrigation pivot near Hummingbird Road and Benson Road.",

          "During the evening hours on Sunday, June 18th, a strong thunderstorm developed about 12 miles to the northeast of El Dorado, Arkansas in Union County. Shortly after forming, the storm became severe and started to rotate. The storm went on to produce an EF-2 tornado, touching down near the Cypress Creek Oil Field to the north of Moro Bay Highway near Stowe Ditch Road. At this location, there were numerous trees either snapped or uprooted from winds around 80 to 85 mph. As the tornado tracked to the southeast towards Moro Bay Highway, it strengthened some which was evident from the more widespread tree damage. As it crossed Moro Bay Highway, it did not cause any major damage to structures despite there being some along the path. From there,|the road network became sparse, but some additional tree damage was observed along Feldmann Road to the southeast of Moro Bay Highway. ||From there, the tornado continued to track southeast, causing significant damage along Pigeon Hill Road. The tornado continued to strengthen as it moved toward New London Road. This is where the greatest destruction was observed as the tornado moved over|a chicken farm and five chicken coops. Three of the five chicken coops were completely destroyed with additional damage to a few other barns and outbuildings. With the amount of tree damage surrounding the chicken coops, along with the total destruction of three of them, the tornado was rated EF-2 with maximum winds at 115 mph. This damage was short-lived and confined to this farm on the west and east side of New London Road. Additionally, there was a tree that fell on a manufactured home just to the north of the farm. The owners of the farm who lived in a brick home were able to call the family in the manufactured home after getting the tornado warning and had them rush to their house. So no one was in the the manufactured home when it took on damage. From there, the tornado continued to track to the southeast with more significant tree damage off Christian Road and North Road to the north of Phelps Road before lifting.",

          "A tornado formed along a line of thunderstorms and made initial touchdown in Cinnaminson, NJ, near the intersection of Riverton Road and Woodside Lane where multiple trees were snapped and uprooted. It then traveled east-southeast towards Cinnaminson High School and Eleanor Rush Intermediate School, where the damage |path expanded to around 0.3 miles wide or about 520 yards, spreading across much of the surrounding neighborhood where numerous trees were reported down. The strongest wind damage occurred near the intersection of Wynwood Drive and Locust Lane where a majority of the roof covering was peeled off a single-family home. The tornado continued east-southeast across US HWY 130 into Lakeview Memorial Park where a large swath of softwood trees were either uprooted or snapped at the trunk. Continuing east-southeast, the damage path continued through the neighborhoods surrounding New Albany Road and Endicott Ave, moving towards the communities near Ravenswood Park, uprooting and snapping multiple trees. The tornado then crossed Haines Mill Road in Delran where it grew to its greatest width of approximately |0.3 miles or 600 yards. After persisting east-southeast and crossing Bridgeboro Road, it likely pushed through Esther Yanai Preserve where the damage path was lost due to lack of road networks in the preserve. Minor tree and limb damage was observed again near John Pryor Field in Moorestown. More widespread damage was then found near the intersection of Hartford Road and Worthington Drive with multiple softwood trees uprooted or snapped. The wide swath of tree damage continued over to Dominion |Drive with numerous trees uprooted or snapped and left leaning on utility lines along Borton Landing Road. It is likely at this point the tornado began to occlude and wrap up. Additional snapped branches and minor damage to veneers and siding was found along a narrow strip of Country Club Drive in the Laurel Creek Country Club neighborhood. The tornado then caused minor damage to some roof shingles on a home on Augusta Drive before snapping the top of one final utility pole on Centerton Road.",
          "A new QLCS tornado developed just west of a neighborhood on Walnford Road southeast of Allentown. The most significant damage from the tornado occurred to properties within the neighborhood, especially those along an open field to the southeast. The tornado was also near its widest point in this area. Numerous trees were uprooted or snapped within the neighborhood. A few homes sustained removal of roofing material, siding removal, windows blown out, and a couple garage doors blown out. Damage in this area was consistent with wind speeds estimated to be near 110 mph. An irrigation pivot was blown into a fence separating the neighborhood and the field where it was toppled over, partially into some residential yards.||The tornado continued eastward across the field toward Allentown Davis Station Road where another shorter irrigation pivot was overturned. Along the road, several trees were snapped or uprooted near and northwest of the intersection with Polhemustown Road and Holmesmill Road. A wooden power pole was also leaning in the direction of the tornado's motion. The tornado continued east along Allentown Davis Station Road where more mainly minor tree damage occurred. At the traffic circle intersection with Sharon Station Road, several road signs were blown down in various directions. The tornado moved east-southeastward into a field just south of a farmstead and north of Davis Station Road. The tornado entered another wooded residential area near the intersection of Davis Station Road ans Harvey Road where more significant tree damage occurred and the tornadic circulation widened. The tornado moved east across Meirs Road where numerous trees were snapped or uprooted on residential properties, once of which fell onto power lines. The tornado moved east toward a residential neighborhood along Long Acre Drive where some additional tree damage occurred. The |tornado moved east of the residential area across a tree line and then dissipated in an open field along Emleys Hill-Prospertown Road.",
          "A tornado formed from along an eastward moving rotating supercell within a line of thunderstorms and made initial touchdown near Patterson road, off of West Commodore Road, in Jackson Township and continued east for approximately a 3/4 mile long and 200 yard width path across the residences on the north side of Stonehenge Ct and along West Commodore Blvd, before going across the residences and businesses across Wright Debow and Hamilton Rd. Dozens of large hardwood and softwood trees were snapped or uprooted in a convergent pattern, power poles downed or snapped, fences demolished, and sheds, small outbuildings, and dumpsters flipped or moved. Despite the significant tree damage, generally only minor siding and roof shingle damage was noted. This damage was consistent with EF1 winds of 90 to 110 mph. ||The tornado then likely strengthened to its greatest intensity as it continued east, across a cleared and paved area, to a newly built large warehouse development. The southern half of the warehouse, made up of several 3 story concrete pre-fab tilt-up |walls, both on the east and west side, tied together with metal roofing system above, collapsed in an eastward direction. Based on the degree of damage and construction this was determined to be high end EF2 winds of 120 to 130 mph. In addition dozens of hard and soft wood trees on the south and southeast side of the building and east side parking lot were uprooted or trunks snapped laying in a E/NE direction. ||The tornado continued on, now in an east southeast direction, for about 3/4 mile with about 200 yd path width, just north of GasTime, across Diamond Road and back along West Commodore road, and into the residences around Indiero Lane and Oaktree Lanes. The most extensive tree and powerline damage was seen along West Commodore Road, with hundreds of mature hard and soft wood trees uprooted or snapped in a convergent pattern, numerous power poles downed or snapped, as well as roofing and insulation debris from the warehouse being littered along the way. The tree damage along part of West Commodore Road was consistent with winds of 100 to 120 mph. The tornado appeared to be weakening to EF0 as it entered the residences around Indiero Lane and Oaktree Lanes, south of West Commodore, with the tree damage path becoming scattered and narrowing to 100 yards, and only minor siding and roof shingle damage noted. The tornado likely occluded just before reaching the|Land O Pines Mobile Home Park, where the tornado path ended.",
          "A tornado formed from an east southeast moving rotating supercell within a line of thunderstorms and made a brief touchdown on the National Guard Training Center Grounds in Sea Girt, NJ.||The tornado likely developed over Stockton Lake and tracked east southeast over the New Jersey Youth Challenge Academy. The entire half dome, wood frame, shingled roof of the southwest facing  academy building, about 25 yards wide and 50 yards long, was |lifted and thrown eastward. The debris was lofted and strewn for about 250 yards to the east northeast in a tapering, semi-circled debris drag marks and layout pattern. In addition one tree was uprooted and laid in an east northeast direction. The tornado |likely lifted as it tracked east across the parking lot and open grass fields. Based on the degree of damage and construction this was determined to be EF2 wind damage of 110- 120 mph, with debris and downed tree pattern indicative of a tornado.||Isolated large tree damage was noted upstream of the National Guard Training Center starting at the corner of Sea Girt Ave and Route 35, working east southeast down Sea Girt Avenue, across the intersection of Atlantic and Broad Street, to Pearce Avenue and |behind Manasquan Fire Department. There is not enough evidence in the damage indicators to classify as part of the tornado track, and so more likely associated with a narrow developing rear flank downdraft of 70-80 mph, that shortly later lead to tornado |formation over Stockton Lake. A couple of other notable impacts, 400 yards to the north of the New Jersey Youth Challenge Academy building, a couple of bleachers were pushed about 40 yards east northeast from their starting position across the Athletic field. Once again, not enough supporting evidence for this being a separate EF0 tornado, but instead, more likely due to straight line winds or gustnado of 70 to 80 mph winds.||Finally, a small bleacher was overturned at the Manasquan Little League Fields, about 600 yards southeast of New Jersey Youth Challenge Academy and right before the ocean beachfront, again consistent with straight line winds of 70 to 80 mph. For |reference, the Sea Girt observing site measured a similar 71 mph gust at this time.",

          "This long track, violent tornado began over northern |Issaquena County near Grant Rd, downing multiple trees and damaging |two older outbuildings. It tracked northeastward, producing tree |damage as it crossed the Steele Bayou Canal before crossing into |Sharkey County. At this point, the tornado began to substantially |increase in size and intensity. A very high percentage of trees were |snapped along the path through a wooded area south of Bear Lake Rd. |It was in this wooded area where the first indications of EF3 to EF4 |damage were noted, with at least one tree and root ball and several |more large tree pieces fully displaced into the downstream field. |From this point along the path in Sharkey County, there was a well |defined confluence zone in damage along the center of the tornado |track. ||On the western outskirts of the city of Rolling Fork, homes began to |be impacted with significant roof damage along Bear Lake Rd. Several |tall wooden utility transmission poles were snapped along Bear |Lake Rd and MS Highway 826. Along Pinkins Rd, each structure along|the road, including several manufactured homes and two site built|homes, was demolished. Structures on the west end of the road |were scattered radially southeastward, and structures on the east |end of the road were scattered northward. An occupant of one of |the mobile homes was critically injured during the tornado and |eventually passed away nearly four weeks later. Debarking was |observed on several hardwood trees, with only stubs of the main |branches of some trees remaining. Crossing MS 826 and along |Fleetwood Rd, an older metal building was swept away, a small home|was destroyed and numerous manufactured homes were destroyed. ||As the tornado moved into the western side of Rolling Fork, the |tornadic wind field was broad, encompassing the area from Race St, |where exterior damage occurred to the Sharkey Issaquena Hospital, to |Bear Lake Rd on the south end where several utility poles were |snapped. The corridor of greatest damage on the west side of the |city, rated high end EF3, extended from 7th St between Martin Ave |and Joor Ave to 3rd St between Southern Ave and Lewis Ave. In this |area, multiple homes lost most exterior walls, several more lost |roofs and some walls, and even more received at least minor damage. |Two fatalities occurred along 7th St when a trailer truck was tossed |into a home. Through this corridor, additional debarking of trees |was noted near the center of the path. Brief and minor weakening |occurred as the tornado moved east of 3rd St and began to approach |Deer Creek, with EF2 damage still common. Along the creek, the |fire station, Rolling Fork Elementary School, and South Delta High|School all sustained roof and other exterior damage.||After the tornado crossed Deer Creek and began to move into the |downtown area of Rolling Fork, reintensification occurred. |Additional EF4 damage was noted in the block between Sharkey St and |Worthington Ave and north of Collette Ave where a home and a duplex |apartment were entirely demolished, with the foundation of the |duplex partially swept. Large metal buildings at an agriculture |business at the intersection of East St and West Ave were destroyed. |A fatality occurred when a mobile home along Worthington Ave was |destroyed. On Parkway Ave, a Masonic lodge was leveled and a gas |station was substantially damaged. ||The tornado then crossed Rolling Fork Creek, damaging and destroying |several structures along McLaurin St and China St. A water tower |east of Hicks Ave, which was in service at the time of the tornado, |was felled in a southeastward direction, perpendicular to the |tornado path. In the downtown area, the roof was removed from the |Rolling Fork US Post Office, portions of Rolling Fork City Hall, and |portions of the Rolling Fork Police Department. The Sharkey County |Courthouse received damage to the roof and some windows, with the |cupola removed. Additional EF4 damage was observed as the tornado |crossed Walnut St, with multiple homes and businesses having all or |most walls downed. One building in this corridor was compromised by |two tossed tractor trailers and another was compromised by a |southward facing metal door. A fatality occurred when a mobile home |off Sidney Alexander St north of Walnut St was destroyed.||The tornado reached its peak intensity as it approached US Highway |61 just north of Walnut St. Multiple brick homes along Mulberry St |were leveled, with debris remaining on the foundations. A discount |retail chain store was completely destroyed, with much of the debris |swept to the downstream side of the foundation and rowed along the |tornado path. Two people died at this location. A gift/floral shop |was destroyed, with most debris swept from the foundation. |Additional businesses, including a lumber/hardware store, two |restaurants, a furniture store, and an insurance agency were also |destroyed in this area. One occupant of a truck traveling along US |61 was killed when the tornado tossed his vehicle from the highway |to near the lumber/hardware store. A mobile/manufactured home park |on the east side of US 61 was devastated, with all 30-35 homes |destroyed. Considerable debris from these homes was rowed 300-400|yards downstream along the tornado path into an adjacent field |and stand of trees. Six occupants of these homes died in the |tornado.||The tornado remained strong to violent as it continued northeast of |Rolling Fork across mainly open fields. Through these fields, aerial |imagery revealed multiple areas of ground scarring. The tornado |crossed Matthews Rd near a catfish farm, where several utility poles |were snapped near the ground and covered in 1 to 2 inches of mud. |Some of the poles were tossed into nearby ponds. Prolific tree |damage occurred along Sandy Bayou, with a few buildings along the |outer edges of the path damaged and a tractor trailer flipped. |Another area of EF4 damage was observed from Widow Bayou and E River |Rd northeastward through Dogwood Rd and Linsey Rd. Through this |corridor, extraordinary hardwood tree damage occurred with most |trees completely mangled and debarking noted. There was additional |evidence of trees or large parts of trees being tossed or dragged a |short distance. Several utility poles were snapped, with some tossed |a short distance. An outbuilding type structure off Dogwood Rd was |blown away, with a school bus from the property tossed into nearby |trees. Ground scarring and cycloidal marks were observed in the |field between Dogwood Rd and Linsey Rd, along with mulched tree |debris which was rowed into a narrow line along the center of the |tornado path. Tree damage continued across Keith Rd and Charlie Pitt |Rd as the tornado approached MS Highway 14.||East of Anguilla along MS Highway 14, a frame home was completely|destroyed. Near the home, several power poles were snapped or |broken. Tree damage was extensive with large areas mowed down. A |tenth of a mile east, a mobile home was rolled into nearby trees. |Moving into Humphreys County, along Prudent Rd, most of the roof |was taken off of a home, where the garage collapsed along with a |portion of the front porch. One vehicle was flipped and another |was moved. A metal workshop was destroyed and structural beams |were bent. Along the road, several power poles were snapped and |thrown a couple hundred feet into a nearby field. As the tornado |approached and crossed Seven Mile Rd, intensity increased. Here, |several metal buildings were heavily damaged or destroyed with |structural beams bent. Grain bins had sides collapsed and the tops|blown off. A small brick home was completely destroyed with all |of the exterior walls collapsed. The home next door had a large |portion of the roof removed and part of a wall had collapsed. |Debris from the home was thrown several hundred feet into a nearby|field. Vehicles were moved out of the garage and a large grain |storage cart was thrown into the field as well. ||For several miles, the tornado traveled along MS Highway 149 |moving toward Silver City where large areas of hardwood trees were|snapped and uprooted. Multiple center pivot irrigation systems |were flipped. A mobile home was completely destroyed when it was |rolled into a nearby field. A portion of the roof was blown off a |school. A community along the same road had several homes with |significant roof damage, and at least one home had decking |material partially removed. Several homes and a large metal |building were severely damaged when portions of the roof were |blown off. A second metal building was completely destroyed with |large structural posts bent. ||As the tornado came into Silver City from the west along Highway |149, an apartment complex was heavily damaged. Several buildings |had sections of the roof removed and one building had portions of |the western walls partially collapsed. A fatality occurred in one|of the single story apartment buildings. In the nearby |neighborhood, numerous homes had roof damage. At least two frame |homes were destroyed where one or more exterior walls collapsed. A|large number of old hardwood trees were snapped or uprooted. As |the storm moved east toward US 49W, more trees were snapped and |uprooted. Several homes and a church near the intersection of |MS Highway 14 and US 49W had areas of the roof damaged or |removed. Four mobile homes were completely destroyed. One person |died when a mobile home was tossed into a house, and a child died|in one of the mobile homes that was destroyed. Numerous trees |were snapped and uprooted, a few of which fell on homes. The |rating in the Silver City area ranged from EF1-EF2. ||The tornado continued to track east where mostly tree damage |occurred.

          "This long track, violent tornado began over northern Issaquena County near Grant Rd, downing multiple trees and damaging two older outbuildings. It tracked northeastward, producing tree damage as it crossed the Steele Bayou Canal before crossing into Sharkey County. At this point, the tornado began to substantially increase in size and intensity. A very high percentage of trees were snapped along the path through a wooded area south of Bear Lake Rd. It was in this wooded area where the first indications of EF3 to EF4 damage were noted, with at least one tree and root ball and several more large tree pieces fully displaced into the downstream field. From this point along the path in Sharkey County, there was a well defined confluence zone in damage along the center of the tornado track. On the western outskirts of the city of Rolling Fork, homes began to be impacted with significant roof damage along Bear Lake Rd. Several tall wooden utility transmission poles were snapped along Bear Lake Rd and MS Highway 826. Along Pinkins Rd, each structure along the road, including several manufactured homes and two site built homes, was demolished. Structures on the west end of the road were scattered radially southeastward, and structures on the east end of the road were scattered northward. An occupant of one of the mobile homes was critically injured during the tornado and eventually passed away nearly four weeks later. Debarking was observed on several hardwood trees, with only stubs of the main branches of some trees remaining. Crossing MS 826 and along Fleetwood Rd, an older metal building was swept away, a small home was destroyed and numerous manufactured homes were destroyed. As the tornado moved into the western side of Rolling Fork, the tornadic wind field was broad, encompassing the area from Race St, where exterior damage occurred to the Sharkey Issaquena Hospital, to Bear Lake Rd on the south end where several utility poles were snapped. The corridor of greatest damage on the west side of the city, rated high end EF3, extended from 7th St between Martin Ave and Joor Ave to 3rd St between Southern Ave and Lewis Ave. In this area, multiple homes lost most exterior walls, several more lost roofs and some walls, and even more received at least minor damage. Two fatalities occurred along 7th St when a trailer truck was tossed into a home. Through this corridor, additional debarking of trees was noted near the center of the path. Brief and minor weakening occurred as the tornado moved east of 3rd St and began to approach Deer Creek, with EF2 damage still common. Along the creek, the fire station, Rolling Fork Elementary School, and South Delta High School all sustained roof and other exterior damage. After the tornado crossed Deer Creek and began to move into the downtown area of Rolling Fork, reintensification occurred. Additional EF4 damage was noted in the block between Sharkey St and Worthington Ave and north of Collette Ave where a home and a duplex apartment were entirely demolished, with the foundation of the duplex partially swept. Large metal buildings at an agriculture business at the intersection of East St and West Ave were destroyed. A fatality occurred when a mobile home along Worthington Ave was destroyed. On Parkway Ave, a Masonic lodge was leveled and a gas station was substantially damaged. The tornado then crossed Rolling Fork Creek, damaging and destroying several structures along McLaurin St and China St. A water tower east of Hicks Ave, which was in service at the time of the tornado, was felled in a southeastward direction, perpendicular to the tornado path. In the downtown area, the roof was removed from the Rolling Fork US Post Office, portions of Rolling Fork City Hall, and portions of the Rolling Fork Police Department. The Sharkey County Courthouse received damage to the roof and some windows, with the cupola removed. Additional EF4 damage was observed as the tornado crossed Walnut St, with multiple homes and businesses having all or most walls downed. One building in this corridor was compromised by two tossed tractor trailers and another was compromised by a southward facing metal door. A fatality occurred when a mobile home off Sidney Alexander St north of Walnut St was destroyed. The tornado reached its peak intensity as it approached US Highway 61 just north of Walnut St. Multiple brick homes along Mulberry St were leveled, with debris remaining on the foundations. A discount retail chain store was completely destroyed, with much of the debris swept to the downstream side of the foundation and rowed along the tornado path. Two people died at this location. A gift/floral shop was destroyed, with most debris swept from the foundation. Additional businesses, including a lumber/hardware store, two restaurants, a furniture store, and an insurance agency were also destroyed in this area. One occupant of a truck traveling along US 61 was killed when the tornado tossed his vehicle from the highway to near the lumber/hardware store. A mobile/manufactured home park on the east side of US 61 was devastated, with all 30-35 homes destroyed. Considerable debris from these homes was rowed 300-400 yards downstream along the tornado path into an adjacent field and stand of trees. Six occupants of these homes died in the tornado. The tornado remained strong to violent as it continued northeast of Rolling Fork across mainly open fields. Through these fields, aerial imagery revealed multiple areas of ground scarring. The tornado crossed Matthews Rd near a catfish farm, where several utility poles were snapped near the ground and covered in 1 to 2 inches of mud. Some of the poles were tossed into nearby ponds. Prolific tree damage occurred along Sandy Bayou, with a few buildings along the outer edges of the path damaged and a tractor trailer flipped. Another area of EF4 damage was observed from Widow Bayou and E River Rd northeastward through Dogwood Rd and Linsey Rd. Through this corridor, extraordinary hardwood tree damage occurred with most trees completely mangled and debarking noted. There was additional evidence of trees or large parts of trees being tossed or dragged a short distance. Several utility poles were snapped, with some tossed a short distance. An outbuilding type structure off Dogwood Rd was blown away, with a school bus from the property tossed into nearby trees. Ground scarring and cycloidal marks were observed in the field between Dogwood Rd and Linsey Rd, along with mulched tree debris which was rowed into a narrow line along the center of the tornado path. Tree damage continued across Keith Rd and Charlie Pitt Rd as the tornado approached MS Highway 14. East of Anguilla along MS Highway 14, a frame home was completely destroyed. Near the home, several power poles were snapped or broken. Tree damage was extensive with large areas mowed down. A tenth of a mile east, a mobile home was rolled into nearby trees. Moving into Humphreys County, along Prudent Rd, most of the roof was taken off of a home, where the garage collapsed along with a portion of the front porch. One vehicle was flipped and another was moved. A metal workshop was destroyed and structural beams were bent. Along the road, several power poles were snapped and thrown a couple hundred feet into a nearby field. As the tornado approached and crossed Seven Mile Rd, intensity increased. Here, several metal buildings were heavily damaged or destroyed with structural beams bent. Grain bins had sides collapsed and the tops blown off. A small brick home was completely destroyed with all of the exterior walls collapsed. The home next door had a large portion of the roof removed and part of a wall had collapsed. Debris from the home was thrown several hundred feet into a nearby field. Vehicles were moved out of the garage and a large grain storage cart was thrown into the field as well. For several miles, the tornado traveled along MS Highway 149 moving toward Silver City where large areas of hardwood trees were snapped and uprooted. Multiple center pivot irrigation systems were flipped. A mobile home was completely destroyed when it was rolled into a nearby field. A portion of the roof was blown off a school. A community along the same road had several homes with significant roof damage, and at least one home had decking material partially removed. Several homes and a large metal building were severely damaged when portions of the roof were blown off. A second metal building was completely destroyed with large structural posts bent. As the tornado came into Silver City from the west along Highway 149, an apartment complex was heavily damaged. Several buildings had sections of the roof removed and one building had portions of the western walls partially collapsed. A fatality occurred in one of the single story apartment buildings. In the nearby neighborhood, numerous homes had roof damage. At least two frame homes were destroyed where one or more exterior walls collapsed. A large number of old hardwood trees were snapped or uprooted. As the storm moved east toward US 49W, more trees were snapped and uprooted. Several homes and a church near the intersection of MS Highway 14 and US 49W had areas of the roof damaged or removed. Four mobile homes were completely destroyed. One person died when a mobile home was tossed into a house, and a child died in one of the mobile homes that was destroyed. Numerous trees were snapped and uprooted, a few of which fell on homes. The rating in the Silver City area ranged from EF1-EF2. The tornado continued to track east where mostly tree damage occurred. In rural portions of Holmes County northeast of Tchula, there was substantial tree damage with swaths of snapped and uprooted trees. Several center pivot irrigation systems were overturned and grain bins were flipped or destroyed. The tornado continued to move northeast before dissipating in a wooded area north of Randall Road.

          "New high resolution areal imagery in concert with a reanalysis of radar data, areal surveys and ground surveys it has been determined that there were multiple tornadoes on the ground simultaneously in southwest Spalding and Northwestern Pike Counties as well as crossing tornado paths. The tornadoes were part of a larger mesocyclone which can be traced west all the way back to the Selma Alabama tornado. Our analysis determined that this tornado spun up near the center of the main mesocylone as it crossed the Flint River in SW Spalding County. The first evidence of a tornado touching down appear along Blanton Mill Road where several trees were uprooted. This tornado would become caught within the larger circulation and swing SE around the center through mostly wooded or swampy areas of SW Spalding County. Numerous trees were snapped or uprooted in a path that that tracks ESE until it reaches Scott Barch Road. It is in this area it crosses the path of a tornado which passes approximately 2 minutes early moving NE on the eastern periphery of the larger mesocyclone. Low end EF1 damage occurred to a barn in this area, however, it could have occurred with the first tornado. Numerous trees are uprooted or snapped in this area as well. The tornado continued ESE crossing Flat Creek causing mid range EF1 damage to trees. It is noted per areal imagery and radar data that as the tornado approached Yarborough Rd and Shackleford Road it become absorbed/merged with a larger stronger circulation/tornado moving to the NE. Damage on the ground in this area is indicative of tornadoes coming in from 2 different directions. The particular circulation is terminated at this point as the larger more dominate tornado continues NE toward a rock quarry along Rover Zetalla Road. It should also be noted that EF2 damage occurred shortly after these 2 tornadoes merged near Yarborough Road but will be attributed to the more dominate circulation.",

          "This long track, violent tornado began over northern |Issaquena County near Grant Rd, downing multiple trees and damaging |two older outbuildings. It tracked northeastward, producing tree |damage as it crossed the Steele Bayou Canal before crossing into |Sharkey County. At this point, the tornado began to substantially |increase in size and intensity. A very high percentage of trees were |snapped along the path through a wooded area south of Bear Lake Rd. |It was in this wooded area where the first indications of EF3 to EF4 |damage were noted, with at least one tree and root ball and several |more large tree pieces fully displaced into the downstream field. |From this point along the path in Sharkey County, there was a well |defined confluence zone in damage along the center of the tornado |track. ||On the western outskirts of the city of Rolling Fork, homes began to |be impacted with significant roof damage along Bear Lake Rd. Several |tall wooden utility transmission poles were snapped along Bear |Lake Rd and MS Highway 826. Along Pinkins Rd, each structure along|the road, including several manufactured homes and two site built|homes, was demolished. Structures on the west end of the road |were scattered radially southeastward, and structures on the east |end of the road were scattered northward. An occupant of one of |the mobile homes was critically injured during the tornado and |eventually passed away nearly four weeks later. Debarking was |observed on several hardwood trees, with only stubs of the main |branches of some trees remaining. Crossing MS 826 and along |Fleetwood Rd, an older metal building was swept away, a small home|was destroyed and numerous manufactured homes were destroyed. ||As the tornado moved into the western side of Rolling Fork, the |tornadic wind field was broad, encompassing the area from Race St, |where exterior damage occurred to the Sharkey Issaquena Hospital, to |Bear Lake Rd on the south end where several utility poles were |snapped. The corridor of greatest damage on the west side of the |city, rated high end EF3, extended from 7th St between Martin Ave |and Joor Ave to 3rd St between Southern Ave and Lewis Ave. In this |area, multiple homes lost most exterior walls, several more lost |roofs and some walls, and even more received at least minor damage. |Two fatalities occurred along 7th St when a trailer truck was tossed |into a home. Through this corridor, additional debarking of trees |was noted near the center of the path. Brief and minor weakening |occurred as the tornado moved east of 3rd St and began to approach |Deer Creek, with EF2 damage still common. Along the creek, the |fire station, Rolling Fork Elementary School, and South Delta High|School all sustained roof and other exterior damage.||After the tornado crossed Deer Creek and began to move into the |downtown area of Rolling Fork, reintensification occurred. |Additional EF4 damage was noted in the block between Sharkey St and |Worthington Ave and north of Collette Ave where a home and a duplex |apartment were entirely demolished, with the foundation of the |duplex partially swept.

One vehicle was flipped and another |was moved. A metal workshop was destroyed and structural beams |were bent. Along the road, several power poles were snapped and |thrown a couple hundred feet into a nearby field. As the tornado |approached and crossed Seven Mile Rd, intensity increased. Here, |several metal buildings were heavily damaged or destroyed with |structural beams bent. Grain bins had sides collapsed and the tops|blown off. A small brick home was completely destroyed with all |of the exterior walls collapsed. The home next door had a large |portion of the roof removed and part of a wall had collapsed. |Debris from the home was thrown several hundred feet into a nearby|field. Vehicles were moved out of the garage and a large grain |storage cart was thrown into the field as well. ||For several miles, the tornado traveled along MS Highway 149 |moving toward Silver City where large areas of hardwood trees were|snapped and uprooted. Multiple center pivot irrigation systems |were flipped. A mobile home was completely destroyed when it was |rolled into a nearby field. A portion of the roof was blown off a |school. A community along the same road had several homes with |significant roof damage, and at least one home had decking |material partially removed. Several homes and a large metal |building were severely damaged when portions of the roof were |blown off. A second metal building was completely destroyed with |large structural posts bent. ||As the tornado came into Silver City from the west along Highway |149, an apartment complex was heavily damaged. Several buildings |had sections of the roof removed and one building had portions of |the western walls partially collapsed. A fatality occurred in one|of the single story apartment buildings. In the nearby |neighborhood, numerous homes had roof damage. At least two frame |homes were destroyed where one or more exterior walls collapsed. A|large number of old hardwood trees were snapped or uprooted. As |the storm moved east toward US 49W, more trees were snapped and |uprooted. Several homes and a church near the intersection of |MS Highway 14 and US 49W had areas of the roof damaged or |removed. Four mobile homes were completely destroyed. One person |died when a mobile home was tossed into a house, and a child died|in one of the mobile homes that was destroyed. Numerous trees |were snapped and uprooted, a few of which fell on homes.

This long track tornado began in Autauga County and tracked across northwest Elmore County, southern Coosa County and into Tallapoosa about one mile south of Newman Road.  Tornado damage continued into Tallapoosa County with a corridor of timber damaged observed along Cedar Creek and Elkahatchee Roads. Timber was snapped and uprooted and consistent with EF1 damage here. The tornado continued northeast crossing Highway 63 and approaching the Wind Creek State Park area.  The tornado then moved toward Coven Abbett Highway and then Elbert Road. Several homes sustained damage here, some significant with roofs blown off, boat houses destroyed, and adjacent significant timber damage as dozens of large hardwood trees were snapped and uprooted. Areas impacted near here were Elbert Drive, Loblolly Lane, and Elbert Road. The tornado then crossed the northern section of Lake Martin before impacting additional lakefront homes. Numerous homes were damaged on River Run Road and the adjacent side streets. Some homes sustained significant damage with entire roofs blown away and exterior walls collapsed or removed. At least two homes were shifted from their foundation. The high-end EF-2 damage here could be partly due to the interaction of the tornado with the lake surface, as well as the exposed nature of these homes since most structures inland seemed to be sheltered from adjacent heavily wooded areas. The tornado also damaged homes along Lake Ridge Drive. The tornado continued northeast causing pockets of EF1 timber damage as it crossed Highway 280. The tornado then moved across the rest of Tallapoosa County causing mainly varying degrees of timber damage in the EF0 to EF1 range, including the Sessions area. The weakening tornado then crossed into Chambers County just north of Highway 118.",

The tornado then continued northward and crossed Fish Creek Road with damage to another home that removed the roof and caused significant damage in the walls of the second level of the home. It also did significant damage to a second barn and snapped many hardwood trees.||After moving north of Fish Creek Road, the tornado crossed a large swamp with evidence of full defoliation of a few hardwood trees in the swamp. Tornadic damage become less continuous north of this point without good road access to the track through swampy land.  Convergent track damage again resumed well southwest of the Town of Turin, hitting the town water tower. The tornado then continued northward as it paralleled West Road. Continuous uprooting, snapping, and occasional defoliation of hard and softwood trees was evident for a long portion of the track until it reached Snow Ridge Ski Resort. Upon reaching Snow Ridge Ski Resort, tree damage increased to snapping of hardwood trees at the rootline and some defoliation. On the ski resort land, all of the chair lift metal cables failed, some chair lift structures were overturned or damaged, and the track of damage greatly widened as the storm continued north- |northeastward. The greatest damage along the entire track of the tornado was from Snow Ridge Ski Resort to the West Wind Motel in Turin. Several structures saw completed roof failures, interior wall failures, window failures, and a one multi-story building was shifted from its foundation with its entire roof removed. The tornado lifted after affecting the West Wind Motel with damage ceasing from this point as it crossed State Route 26.",
          "The National Weather Service in Buffalo completed a storm survey in Lewis County for damage that is confirmed to be tornadic from Monday evening.

          "National Weather Service meteorologists surveyed damage in northern Hale County and determined that it was consistent with an EF2 tornado, with maximum winds near 115 mph. This tornado originated in northeast Greene County and crossed into Hale County west of Akron along the Black Warrior River.  The most significant damage was on the Hale County side of the river along Flemming Road and Oak Village Road. Many manufactured homes were destroyed on Flemming Road, mostly due to uprooted and snapped hardwood trees.  One home on Oak Village Road sustained significant damage after garage failure occurred. This resulted in adjacent walls collapsing and most of the roof structure being blown north into the river. Additional timber and varying degrees of structural damage was observed to the end of Oak Village Road. The tornado continued northeast, but is believed to have weakened or skipped along its path. Only minor timber damage was found near the Stewart community and along Highway 69. However, more significant timber damage was found downstream on County Road 50, entering the Talladega National Forest. Hardwood trees were snapped and uprooted with a path width around 300 yards at this point as the tornado strengthened. The tornado continued northeast and crossed into the far southeast corner of Tuscaloosa County.",
          "National Weather Service meteorologists surveyed damage in northern Autauga County and determined that it was consistent with an EF3 tornado, with maximum winds near 150 mph.  This long-track tornado began west of Highway 82, where timber damage occurred to farms near the community of Independence. The tornado crossed Highway 82 and strengthened as a manufactured home was rolled along Autauga County Road 40. Over the next two miles, the tornado rapidly strengthened as it approached the Old Kingston community, where EF3 damage began along County Road 43. At this location, at least three manufactured homes were obliterated with their frames thrown up to 100 yards. A pickup truck was sent airborne and landed 120 yards to the northeast, where a shallow crater was formed by its impact. The tornado became deadly as it impacted several homes along Sandy Ridge Road. The frame of a manufactured home at the western end of the road was thrown 250 yards to the north-northeast and came to rest in a field. Just downstream, several manufactured homes in a cluster were shredded and thrown considerable distances. Trees were snapped off relatively close to the ground and partially debarked. In total, five fatalities occurred along Sandy Ridge Road at three separate residences. Similar damage continued to the northeast along County Road 140, where two fatalities occurred in two separate residences at the eastern end of the road. At least five manufactured homes were blown away with their frames thrown considerable distances. Several vehicles were picked up and thrown, and one pickup truck had its cab separated from the bed. From this area to County Road 42, the tornado caused massive tree damage and what appeared to be stands of debarked trees along Autauga Creek. In the three mile stretch of most severe damage from County Road 43 to County Road 42, wind speeds reached at least 150 mph. The tornado tracked across County Road 57 at a slightly weaker state, where numerous trees were snapped and uprooted with several homes sustaining significant roof damage with one site-built home also sustaining partial wall failure. The tornado crossed Interstate 65 where numerous trees were uprooted. In the Pine Level community, several homes sustained roof damage and a manufactured home was rolled off its foundation and onto County Road 68. Many trees were uprooted and snapped as the tornado crossed through the Pine Flat community. Additional homes sustained roof damage and other damage from fallen trees, and a manufactured home was rolled and destroyed. Residential structure damage intensified as the tornado neared the Autauga/Elmore county line where several site-built homes sustained a majority or entire roof removal along County Road 68 near Poplar Springs Road.  The tornado crossed into Elmore County just north of Highway 68.",

          "A tornado developed within a line of thunderstorms northwest of Johnson Lake in far southern Dawson county just before 11:00 PM on Friday, May 5th. The tornado appeared to begin a couple miles northwest of the toppled three irrigation pivots before hitting the Lakeview Acres area on the northwest side of the lake. At least two large storage sheds were totally destroyed in that area. There were several instances of damage in the area, such as trees, smaller buildings, windows and some roof damage,|including two 2x4 stud driven into the roof of one home. The tornado traversed east across the lake and did significant damage to several homes on the east side of the lake right along the Gosper county line. Along the shore line, at least three homes in a row had all or part of a covered porch blown apart, and one home had a large section of its roof torn off. Another flat roof cabin had its entire roof torn off. A few power poles were snapped. Tree damage was common in this general area. The tornado moved east and upset an irrigation pivot and peeled back some metal roofing from a large building just east of the lake. The tornado likely dissipated east of County Road 428. The |maximum wind speed was estimated to be 95 MPH based upon the residential roof damage and the storage building being destroyed. The path was just under 5 miles long and the width was estimated to be 80 yards.",

          "Actual storm survey determined that tornado likely started and ended within the same minute, only traveling 0.3 miles in that time span. Starting location was 38.4464/-83.6408 and ending location was 38.4482/-83.6352. Due to limitations within the Storm Data interface, could not track the path of the storm since it shows the same start/end time. ||Damage was first observed on a property at the intersection of |Beechburg Road and Colgan Road, where the tornado directly |impacted several structures, including a wooden barn, a mobile |home, a shed, and a larger open barn located behind. All sides of |the mobile home sustained damage, including a large board impaled|into the roof, and some blunt force impacts from pieces of the |nearby barn that collapsed. Vehicles parked to the north and |northeast of the barn sustained heavy damage as it collapsed and |sections became airborne. Next the tornado hit a larger open- air|barn housing heavy equipment. Roof panels were torn off the west |side of the barn and sent up to 200 yards to the ENE. A little |ways down the road, another mobile home sustained blunt force |damage, including a large hole that punctured through into the |interior, as well as wind damage to all sides. Metal roofing from |the barn was found in a grove of trees to the northeast of this |house. The next door neighbor to the east faired better, but it |had debris from the metal barn in their yard, minor wind damage, |and a flagpole which was bent at the base laying northward. |Slightly farther up the road, the next property sustained major |tree damage, including several snapped trees and an uprooted tree,|though no structural damage. The tornado picked up a goat |enclosure in a grove of trees, lifted it over a fence, leaving the|fence untouched, and then tore the structure apart and twisted it|across the front yard of the property.

          "National Weather Service meteorologists surveyed damage in southern Coosa County and determined that it was consistent with an EF3 tornado, with maximum winds near 140 mph.  This long track tornado began in Autauga County and tracked across northwest Elmore County and into southern Coosa County just west of Highway 231. Structural damage across Coosa County continued to consist of roof uplift or removal and damage from wind-blown debris and fallen trees.  A manufactured home was destroyed near Highway 231 along with numerous uprooted trees. Radar showed a debris ball in southern Coosa County which matched ground observations of a truly extensive area of snapped pine trees along McKissick Road, located between the communities of Speed and Equality. The volume of snapped trees was enough to assign an EF3 rating for this segment of the tornado path. Additional significant damage occurred along County Road 18 where vehicles were moved or flipped, numerous trees were snapped, and site-built homes were heavily damaged with one destroyed. This was another area assigned EF-3 intensity. The tornado continued northeastward toward the Coosa/Tallapoosa county line where additional, relatively less intense timber damage was noted.

          "A storm survey of Pontotoc County confirmed an EF-2 tornado moved across the area around 12:00 a.m. CST on April 1. The tornado began in far western Pontotoc County, around Antioch Road, with a few trees downed and tree limbs snapped. Along Highway 9 and Houpt Road, tree damage became more significant, and a few homes and outbuildings sustained damage. A brick home on Highway 9 sustained heavy damage to the front side, mostly caused by a large uprooted tree. Damage in this area was rated EF-1. Weaker damage continued south of the Springville community before another area of EF-1 damage was noted along Highway 341 at Foster Lane. Here a brick home sustained significant roof loss, caused partially by the uplift of an open-air carport. A few other homes had roof damage as the tornado continued to the south side of Pontotoc. A swath of more intense damage ran from Highway 15 across Highway 41 and East 10th Street, with numerous homes sustaining considerable damage. The tornado reached EF-2 intensity in this area, based on a double-wide mobile home being swept away, two brick homes having significant roof loss, and a large anchored garage being destroyed. Bolted footings that remained in place were observed in the garage. Damage to other homes in the area was rated EF-1, and many trees were uprooted, with a good number of snaps as well. Significant tree damage, along with minor structural damage, continued across Horseshoe Bend, Hall Road, and New Hope Road, maintaining EF-1 intensity. After briefly weakening near Highway 278, the tornado encountered the College Hill Lane neighborhood along Old Highway 6. Here, more significant damage was observed to structures and trees, mostly pines. A site-built home lost part of its roof, and a neighboring double-wide was swept away and scattered south and east, resulting in a fatality. Additionally, other homes sustained minor damage, and a small barber shop building was rolled and destroyed. Damage continued in the EF-0 range from Faulkner Road to near the Lee County line, with several more homes being damaged and numerous trees being uprooted. The more severe home damage in this area appeared to be a combination of tree failure or uplift of garages/carports, thus the rating was kept at high-end EF-0. At Country Oaks Circle, a church sign and cemetery sign were blown down, and several headstones in the cemetery sustained damage. The damage path appeared to end in a grove of trees just south of Old Highway 6, and no damage was observed on County Road 41 at the Pontotoc/Lee county line. Along the track, 12 homes were destroyed and 120 were damaged. Peak estimated winds in Pontotoc County were 120 mph.

The tornado then strengthened to its strongest and widest point between Cottonwood Trail and Karley Lane, producing the most widespread structure damage along its path here. About half of the roofs of several homes were destroyed, and the backside of the homes sustained severe damage as the tornado moved through the area. At this point, the tornado was about 100 yards wide, and produced  peak winds of 120 mph at this location. The last house on the northeast corner of Plantation Springs Drive sustained the worst damage near the golf course, with more than half the roof destroyed and two rooms with walls collapsed at this location. The tornado lifted shortly after this point.",
          "This tornado crossed from Union County into Lee County along County Road 2700 around 12:00 a.m. CST on April 1.  A poorly anchored home sustained roof removal and collapse of several walls, consistent with a high-end EF1 rating. A church had significant roof damage along County Road 231, and other structures were damaged along County Roads 341 and 2726. In particular, a mobile home/camper trailer was flipped and destroyed in this area. The intensity of the damage picked up along County Road 417, where a vacant double-wide mobile home was swept away and a couple of other homes sustained minor damage. Tree damage here was significant as well. The tornado attained EF2 intensity along County Road 503, where a two-story brick home sustained major roof loss, which began with the uplift of the front porch awning. An adjacent 32x32 two-story garage was swept completely away and destroyed, although it appeared to be poorly anchored. Along County Road 601, another home had total roof loss and several walls collapsed, and extensive tree damage was observed across the road. Further eastward along County Road 601, another home was damaged, and several cedar trees were snapped, consistent with an EF1 rating. Another area of heavier tree damage occurred along County Road 2788 at Highway 45. In addition, the sign at the entrance to an industrial park was damaged. Along Pratts Road, a church and a shop building were damaged, and a few more homes were damaged along the north side of Pratts Road. The tornado weakened significantly after this point, with only lighter, more sporadic tree damage. A couple more homes sustained minor roof damage along Cemetery Road and Highway 370 before the tornado dissipated after crossing County Road 2890.  Peak estimated winds in Lee County were 120 mph. Note that part of this tornado occurred after 12:00 am CST on April 1 and much of that data is included in April's Storm Data. The complete narrative for Lee County is included in both March Storm Data and April Storm Data.",

          "National Weather Service meteorologists surveyed damage in northern Marion County and determined that it was consistent with an EF1 tornado, with maximum winds near 110 mph. The tornado began on Marion County Road 348 west of Alabama Highway 253 south of Hackleburg, where minor tree damage was noted. The tornado rapidly increased and caused significant damage as it crossed Alabama Highway 253, uprooting several trees and causing superficial damage to a home on the edge of the track. The tornado continued east-northeastward along Union Hill Road, crossing the road twice before the intersection with Chalk Mine Road. Damage in this segment of the path consisted solely of pockets of tree damage which varied in intensity but was easily identified as tornado damage. As the tornado paralleled Chalk Mine Road, it produced more widespread tree damage, and destroyed a manufactured home. The damage to trees surrounding the manufactured home was minimal, which contributed to a below expected value or 100 mph assigned to the flipping and tossing of the manufactured home. The tornado continued across the Fairview community causing significant tree damage just east of County Road 12, with a grove of pine trees all being sheared off about 20 feet above ground level. The tornado then continued over inaccessible areas south of County Road 6 as it headed towards the Lumbull community, crossing Alabama Highway 241 just south of Lumbull. As it approached Bear Creek, it continued to cause sparse but notable tree damage. The most significant damage along the entire path occurred along Alabama Highway 13 south of Bear Creek, where a large metal building structure received significant damage to the windward side of the building. Winds in this area approached 110 mph, bringing this tornado to a high end EF1 rating. The tornado then crossed AL Hwy 13, where an individual received major injuries as the manufactured home being occupied was flipped upside-down.

The tornado tracked northeast, skirting John Carroll High School before producing significant tree damage along Oak Grove Road. One home was heavily damaged by falling trees, with lesser damage to others, and a large stand of mostly pine trees were snapped or uprooted east of Oak Grove Road. The tornado widened and intensified as it approached Wildwood Parkway. A strip mall there sustained very minor damage. However, a large office complex on the north end of Wildwood Parkway sustained substantial damage. A large number of windows were blown out of a 5-story professional building with many windows and debris blown back westward. A large load bearing beam was also pulled from the roof structure. The tornado is estimated to have reached its maximum intensity here at EF-1 / 100 mph. The tornado continued to move northeast, felling numerous trees south of Kent Drive. Along State Farm Parkway, a couple hotels sustained roof damage, a large hotel sign was blown out, and a vehicle was flipped before it crossed Interstate 65.

Several additional businesses and an apartment complex in this area also sustained minor roof damage. Power poles were snapped in this area as well. Further northeast, the tornado tracked through a densely populated residential area. Here the primary damage was caused by snapping and felling of trees. Many large and mature trees fell through homes in this area, causing moderate to severe damage. The most concentrated area of damage was along and north of Saulter Road and surrounding streets. It is estimated that over three dozen homes in this area sustained at least moderate damage from falling trees. The tornado began to weaken as it tracked on the north side of the Samford University campus with a few trees down in this area. The tornado dissipated near the Windsor Highlands Community along the north edge of the Samford Campus.",
          "A tornado first touched down just north of Lakeshore Parkway along Snow Drive. Here the damage was very light with large tree branches broken. The tornado tracked northeast, skirting John Carroll High School before producing significant tree damage along Oak Grove Road. One home was heavily damaged by falling trees, with lesser damage to others, and a large stand of mostly pine trees were snapped or uprooted east of Oak Grove Road. The tornado widened and intensified as it approached Wildwood Parkway. A strip mall there sustained very minor damage. However, a large office complex on the north end of Wildwood Parkway sustained substantial damage. A large number of windows were blown out of a 5-story professional building with many windows and debris blown back westward. A large load bearing beam was also pulled from the roof structure. The tornado is estimated to have reached its maximum intensity here at EF-1 / 100 mph. The tornado continued to move northeast, felling numerous trees south of Kent Drive. Along State Farm Parkway, a couple hotels sustained roof damage, a large hotel sign was blown out, and a vehicle was flipped before it crossed Interstate 65. The tornado reached its maximum width of approximately 600 yards as it crossed Green Spring Avenue. Significant structural damage was noted to an auto repair shop with the roof blown off. Several additional businesses and an apartment complex in this area also sustained minor roof damage. Power poles were snapped in this area as well.

          "This EF-2 tornado touched down north of C.M. Martin Road to the west of Highway 431 where it blew down a few trees. The tornado crossed Highway 431 south of Main Street where it knocked over some power poles, then continued to blow down trees east of the highway. The tornado moved into southern Springfield near Fairway Trail and Kemper Court, snapping and uprooting trees along many residential streets and causing minor damage to a few homes. More significant damage to homes occurred further northeast on Rudolph Street and Brentlawn Drive. The tornado strengthened as it crossed Highway 41 near the Kroger shopping center, with numerous businesses damaged from high-end EF1 to low-end EF2 intensity (110-115 mph). 25 vehicles in the Kroger parking lot were flipped with some thrown into nearby ditches. The tornado then crossed the railroad tracks behind Kroger and reached its peak intensity as it entered an industrial area, where multiple warehouse structures were heavily damaged. With the majority of these metal building systems having Grade 5 bolts holding down the columns, winds were estimated at EF-2/120 mph in this area. The tornado then struck a fire department and strip mall (EF-1/110 mph) and bent a steel transmission pole at a power substation (EF-2/115 mph) on the east side of the industrial park. As the tornado continued northeast, it significantly weakened but still uprooted trees and caused minor roof damage to homes on Greystone Drive and Sloan Lane. On Roy Pitt Road, the tornado destroyed a two car garage and rolled a trailer on its side (EF-1). The tornado continued to blow down trees as it moved northeast across Highway 76E near Oakland Road before finally lifting north of Sloan Road.",

The tornado briefly weakened as it approached Highway 64 west of Selmer. Widespread tree damage and sporadic damage to structures were noted along Bud Long Road, Highway 64, and John Moore Road, with several utility poles snapped along Highway 64. A church was damaged at Highway 45 and Dowty Road. The glass in the foyer was blown out and some damage to the siding was observed. Just north of the church, a metal building was destroyed and several utility poles were snapped. More significant damage was noted along Main Street just south of Hopkins Street in the Bethel Springs area. Several homes sustained significant damage. This is the same area affected by a tornado a few hours prior with a few of these properties sustaining damage from both tornadoes. The tornado continued to the east-northeast, damaging trees and utility poles on Murray School Road and numerous homes along Bethel Purdy Road. The Community Center on Purdy Beauty Hill Road was completely destroyed and a nearby home suffered severe damage. The tornado intensified as it followed Old Stage Road. Widespread damage to trees, powerlines, and homes was observed from Dogwood Lane to Leapwood Enville Road. Several homes were completely destroyed and four fatalities occurred in this area. Additional home and tree damage was observed along Puron and Neely Sharp Roads with another area of more significant damage near Highway 22 and Winding Ridge Road where another fatality occurred.  In total, nearly 200 structures were damaged in McNairy County between this tornado and the EF-2 that occurred a couple of hours earlier, 91 of which were total losses. The tornado weakened as it moved into Hardin County. Peak winds in McNairy County from this tornado were estimated at 155 mph.",
          "Tornado touched down near Dixie Highway and the north part of the Detroit Beach neighborhood. Damage in this area was mainly large limbs down with winds estimated to 70 mph. Tornado tracked east-northeast through Woodland Beach where greatest damaged occurred with large limbs down and snapped hardwood trees. Estimated winds were to 90 mph with a 400 yd width in this area. Track continued into Baycrest Beach where limbs and a couple trees were down along the lakeshore with estimated winds up to 80 mph. Tornado crossed Pointe Aux Peaux Rd east-southeast of Dixie Highway before exiting over Lake Erie north of Fermi Power Plant. Damage in this portion of the track was EF0 with only limbs down.",
          "Continuation of the tornado that first impacted Montgomery and Boone Counties (as an EF1 and EF0, respectively).  The tornado continued to track to the northeast, parallel to and roughly 0.8 miles southeast of West Manson Colfax Road, while intensifying.  Near the intersection of County Roads 700 South and 750 West a homestead ascertained EF1-intensity damage, with 2 outbuildings on cinder blocks completely destroyed, the collapse of chimney and significant roof damage.||The tornado then reached peak intensity as an EF2 with peak winds of 120 mph, for about 0.5 miles prior to crossing US Highway 52 at the intersection with County Road 650 South.  Through this most-intense segment, a large homestead lost large sections of roof structure, with a garage's brick walls blown out, while a large and poorly-anchored barn was destroyed;  with a collapse of a nearby communications tower.  EF1-intensity damage continued for another 1.6 miles towards Interstate Route 65, as a few barns were completely destroyed across this rural portion of southwestern Clinton County.||The tornado caused minimal EF0-intensity damage for the following 2 miles, including where it crossed Interstate Route 65, while occasionally dropping debris the vortex had picked up earlier in its path.  The circulation restrengthened to EF1 intensity for its final 1.7 miles, causing significant damage just before ending about 3 miles southwest of Frankfort:  hardwood trees were downed at County Road 400 South;  before extensive damage near County Road 300 South which included the destruction of several barns/farm outbuildings among corresponding tree damage, including a concrete tower and a silo (at separate buildings) both leaning southwest, while another farm outbuilding's roof panels were wrapped around trees.",
          "A weak tornado developed in the community of Carpinteria. The EF0 tornado impacted the area near the intersection of Highway 192 and Cravens Lane. In a mobile home park, 26 homes were damaged. Also, several powerlines were blown down. One injury was reported.",
          "A 130MPH EF2  tornado touched down near the confluence of the Pascagoula River and Escatawpa River at 2:48 PM CDT and moved southeast across the River and into the neighborhood on Griffin Street. Widespread tree branches were downed, along with some uprooted trees. Several homes had minor to moderate damage to siding and roofing. A fifth wheel RV was turned over on its side. At 2:54 PM CDT the tornado moved southeast towards Dantzler St. The damage was sporadic as it moved but one house on Bellview Ave took major roof damage, the carport collapsed and a motorhome parked nearby was overturned. It continued east-southeast over wetlands towards Main Street then sharply turned to the south-southeast. The tornado moved south along Main Street between Bellview Ave through E Bayou Ave. Numerous structures took roof damage with the most significant damage seen at the Merchants & Marines Bank and the First Missionary Baptist Church. Both buildings had the majority of the roof removed and several windows blown out. The Church's brick signage was completely destroyed. Several nearby older houses also received significant roof damage. This damage was the peak of this tornado with max winds of 130 mph and max width of 300 yards. The tornado continued southeastward towards Martin Luther King Blvd. The damage was sporadic with mainly trees downed and minor roof damage. The tornado then moved towards the intersection of Jackson St and McCall St where a small multi family home had its roof damaged. Due to the age and the type of construction, the south facing wall collapsed due to the roof damage. The tornado then continued east-southeastward and lifted before it reached Frederick Street at 2:57 PM CDT. Special thanks to the Jackson County Office of Emergency Services for their assistance in the survey including drone footage.",
          "A tornado began near the airport along Warrenton Lane, where some large branches were snapped. The tornado quickly intensified as it moved southeast and snapped and uprooted trees. It was most intense near Burnt House Road, where there was widespread tree damage and a large tree fell on a house. Numerous hardwood trees had snapped trunks and were uprooted. The tornado continued to snap and uproot trees along Funches Road near Drayton Road. There was also significant tree damage along Fisher Ferry Road and Fonsylvania Road. The tornado continued to track southeast and snapped and uprooted trees along an unnamed Warren County Road just south of Halls Ferry before it dissipated in wooded area. Wind gusts were estimated at 110 mph at the strongest. A tornadic debris signature was observed on radar with this tornado.",
          "This squall line tornado began in far northeastern Montgomery County, approximately midway between the communities of Darlington and Colfax, (while, a weaker EF0 tornado was simultaneously spawned about 1.5 miles to the southeast).  The tornado first downed trees (uprooted hardwood and snapped pines) in a distinct 0.5-mile long patch along Withe Creek prior to crossing East Bowers Road, consistent with EF1-intensity winds as high as 94 mph.  The tornado then continued into Boone and Clinton Counties where it would ultimately reach EF2 intensity.",
          "A brief 90MPH EF1 tornado touched down near Cutt Pointe Drive and moved northeast before lifting near Michael Lane. Three manufactured homes were damaged which were the focus of the 90 MPH EF1 rating. One was abandoned and not strapped down and was rolled. The other was also not strapped down and it flew into the third. For that one, the base was strapped down but due to the walls not being well connected to the base and the debris flying into it, the resulting rating was 90 MPH. Otherwise, shingle and siding damage and tree damage were observed. There were 3 injuries with this tornado.",
          "The tornado developed along Three Wheeler Road in extreme southern Panola County. This tornado caused intermittent tree damage as it moved northeast across Cole Road and Crowder Pope Road.

          "This was the third tornado (and only EF1) to impact Howard County. The tornado began in a rural field south of a homestead with two barns, home, and mobile home.  One small barn was completely destroyed along with the mobile home which caused a serious injury.  The home and larger barn had lesser damage. This tornado continued to the northeast, damaging the trees, homes and barns of several homesteads, with maximum winds of 110 mph. The tornado continued into a larger neighborhood near US Highway 35 where it caused mainly roof and tree damage to tree rows.",
          "The tornado began in far eastern Washington County near the town of Hyde and moved east-southeast into northwest Yuma County. In Yuma County, the tornado remained southwest of the city of Yuma, where it looped around three times along the path causing damage to irrigation pivots, trees, and numerous power poles. The tornado dissipated during a fourth large loop. There was also significant damage to a residential property, three grain bins, and a machine shed towards the end of the path. Image of the actual tornado path is attached.",
          "This tornado developed just inside the Beaver-Harper county line. It caused some roof damage and tree damage to a home before crossing into Harper County.",
          "A tornado touched down east of Crossett and south of Hamburg near Highway 425, where it snapped and scattered tree limbs across the property of a community church. The tornado continued along Highway 425 as it uprooted hardwood and softwood trees along the forest line. It then damaged the roof of a house along Highway 425, where it also snapped the trunk of a softwood tree and uprooted several trees in the yard of the residence. The tornado continued northeast, crossing Highway 425, where it struck another residence. A wooden car port was blown across the yard, along with a portion of the roof being damaged on the house. Several large, hardwood trees were uprooted on the far northeastern edge of the property. The tornado weakened and lifted shortly after crossing Ashley County Road 97, where small limbs were scattered across the road. Estimated peak wind speeds were 107 mph.",
          "This tornado began west of Allen Road between Freeman Road and Bowlin Road near the Smithdale community. As it crossed Freeman Road, a sizable portion of the roof of a brick home was removed and blown away from the property. A survey of the home including portions of the roof and rafters indicated a potential weakness of the wood. In addition, a covered porch area that shared a gabled roof with the home likely acted as a lever in lifting the roof from the home. For these reasons, the tornado damage at the site was rated slightly below the expected value for the degree of damage. The tornado then paralleled Allen Road for a short distance, snapping several pine trees, destroying two sheds, and damaging the roof of another house before lifting near the Jordan Lane intersection.",
          "The rotating supercell thunderstorm tracked over the town of Spencer before spawning a second, violent EF3 tornado, that first tracked through extreme northeastern Owen County.  The tornado touched down in the McCormick's Creek State Park Campground Loop B, where EF2-intensity winds produced extensive tree damage.  About 400 yards east the tornado impacted many campers at Campground Loop A, where two campers were killed and two others were injured.  About 1.25 miles to the east-northeast further EF2-intensity damage occurred at Concord Road where large sections of a home's roof were removed while cars where crushed, rolled and thrown;  here along the circulation's southern side the roof was blown off of a mobile home as it slid off its block piers, yet remained upright, consistent with high-end EF1 intensity winds.||The tornado intensified to EF3 strength as it neared the Owen-Monroe County line, with two barns 300-500 feet west of North County Line Road completely gone as their debris was lofted a quarter mile into Monroe County;  a new farm combine weighing about 12 tons and other tractor implements were lofted and thrown 50 yards;  debarking of trees also began near County Line Road, with only stubs of largest branches remaining, from the tornado's strongest winds of 153 mph.  Less intense damage was again observed south of the path's center near the county line where unanchored outbuildings were destroyed by collapsed walls;  and single-family homes experienced minor loss of roofing and broken glass, consistent with EF1-intense winds.  The tornado maintained EF3 intensity while crossing into Monroe County.",
          "Storm chaser video caught a brief landspout tornado forming along the cold front/outflow boundary west of Bird City just east of CR 26 roughly a half mile north of Highway 36.  The boundary was moving quickly to the south, so the landspout did not last long since it was not reported to be crossing the highway.  The landspout formed in a field, so no damage occurred.",
          "Continuation of the Montgomery County EF1 tornado, which ultimately entered Clinton County before reaching EF2 intensity, (a secondary, weaker EF0 tornado simultaneously crossed from Montgomery to Boone County, tracking about 1.0-1.5 miles southeast of this tornado).  Damage along this Boone County segment was mainly along County Road 900 North, where panels from the northeast side of a barn roof were ripped off and carried 0.25 to 0.50 miles east and northeast.  Also, a path of uprooted hardwood trees occurred just northeast of the barn, consistent with high-end EF0-intensity winds as strong as 85 mph.",
          "This was the rotating supercell's first tornado, having traversed through Illinois for nearly 28 miles, producing EF3 damage before entering Indiana.  The tornado crossed the Wabash River, entering Sullivan County 1.8 miles south of Merom.  Near Merom, the tornado severely damaged 3 homes and destroyed a modular home which was thrown at least 200 yards to destruction.  Two occupants of this home were killed.  Also, a large trailer and several cars were thrown tens of yards from their resting location.  The violent winds sheared off trees approximately 20 to 30 feet above ground.||The tornado continued across southern portions of the City of Sullivan. Dozens of homes and structures were severely damaged or destroyed, indicating the strongest winds of the tornado's entire 41-mile track that peaked near 165 mph.  The tornado continued to locations immediately south-southeast, and then southeast of Sullivan, destroying at least 3 additional homes, including a modular home which was thrown at least 150 yards.  One occupant of this home was killed, while the other was injured.   Many trees were again sheared 20 to 30 feet off the ground.  Continuing to the east-northeast, the circulation began to weaken as it continued into a wooded area, damaging numerous trees before lifting off the ground 3.3 miles east of Sullivan.  Much damage in the area reached EF2-intensity (111-135 mph winds), with several locations where winds reached the EF3-intensity (136-165 mph winds).",

          "Several land spouts developed along the flanking line of a|tornadic supercell storm just north of the area.  Two of these|grew significantly and became rather strong and long lived|tornadoes that were documented by several storm chasers in the|area. The stronger of the twins was rated an EF2 based on snapped|power poles along the path, but both mostly remained in open|grasslands.The tornado remained in open county and produced very|little damage outside the occasional prairie scrub brush which it|ripped from the ground. It did cross Highway 70 snapping power|poles at its peak which provided the EF2 rating. The tornado also|crossed Highway 83 before roping out near Wolf Creek Park.",
          "This tornado touched down in southern Cimarron County and|remained in an open field, resulting in no damage. It was on the|ground for a few minutes and less than two miles before lifting.|Given the lack of damage, but witnessed by multiple storm|spotters and chasers, an EFU rating is given to this tornado.",
          "The tornado touched down to the northwest of Perryton and crossed|Highway 143. It entered town, where it caused significant damage|to a mobile home community. Dozens of mobile homes were|completely destroyed. It continued into downtown and caused|structural damage to several downtown shops, some with collapsed|walls. A microwave tower was also folded in half. The tornado|intensified and caused low end EF3 damage to a few retail stores|in downtown and along Ash Street, some of which were completely destroyed. |As the tornado continued to the southeast across Birch and Cedar |Streets, it damaged numerous mobile homes and single family structures, |continuing as an EF2 in this area. A cell phone tower was also brought |down, which resulted in telecommunication outages. The tornado affected an|industrial park area where it tossed several empty fuel tanks|across Texas 143 Loop and into a field. It also pushed a full tanker|truck into a pond along Loop 143.

It crossed Highway 377 and lifted in an|open field before it reached County Road 20.",
          "This tornado developed in an open field and was documented by|storm chasers and trained spotters. It did not hit anything|before dissipating, thus it is rated an EFU damage rating.",
          "This tornado started just to the north of the Jiffy Cleaners,|where some tree limbs broke off a few trees. The top half of a|tree snapped and fell alongside the Cleaners building. A rusty air|conditioning unit lifted from the roof of the cleaners and was|tossed into the median of Ross Osage Road. The sign of Cliffside|Coffee Shop was blown out on the south side of the sign. The|tornado crossed the street and appeared to gain a little more|strength as it caused the brick siding of the Toot N Totum gas |station to collapse. The tornado continued across SE 27th Avenue, |where it caused minor damage to the Stars Drive- In and some cars |in the parking lot had their windows blown out from debris. The |tornado appeared to have dissipated in the field behind the Drive-|In. This tornado was documented by multiple people and we are |grateful for their video evidence. Times were estimated based on |video documentation and may be adjusted with further analysis and |information."
