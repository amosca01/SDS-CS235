<h3>Academic Integrity</h3>
<p>Students are strongly encouraged to form study groups and to collaborate on assignments. The following information is required for all submitted work:</p>

If you did not use any resources in completing the assignment, please state: "I did not utilize any external resources in completing this assignment."</li>
  </ul></p>

<p>You may consult online resources as part of your coursework, but you may not directly copy thoughts or code from online sources.</p>

<p>ChatGPT may not be used to perform the intellectual tasks required to complete an assignment. In other words, your writing and code must be your own, not generated by ChatGPT.</p>

<p>If you have a question about what is considered a violation of this policy, please ask!</p>
<p>You can find the colleges's academic integrity policy here: <a href="https://www.smith.edu/about-smith/offices/student-affairs/student-handbook/academic-honor-code-0" target="_blank">https://www.smith.edu/about-smith/offices/student-affairs/student-handbook/academic-honor-code-0</a>.</p>

If you have already done so, please provide your letter for accommodations to Ab early in the semester so they can arrange those accommodations.</p>

<h3>A note to all students</h3>
<p>I (Ab) am here to support you. If at any point in the semester you realize there is something I could do to better support you, please reach out. This can be something as small as letting me know I am not making the font big enough on my presentations, to sharing that you need some help getting caught up after a hard day or week.</p>
<p>Please be respectful of your classmates and instructor's wellbeing. <b class="w3-text-red">You should not come to class if you are not feeling well.</b> This includes COVID symptoms, and symptoms of non-COVID illnesses. If you need to miss class, I will work with you to stay caught up.</p>
